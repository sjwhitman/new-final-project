Next steps:
1. Create User Account
    a. User can store custom intervals for their work timer and their break timer
    HTML - probably the homepage - form for create Account
    Server - route to handle form submission - creates user instance, adds to database, redirects to login page
    Server - build login page route
    HTML - login page html
2. Users Need Login Option
    HTML - login form submits to login handling route
    Server - log user in, redirect to profile if successful, redirect to login page if not successful
    Server - profile route to render profile page
    HTML - profile page (start basic, something that just shows the username or something)
3.Build out Profile page
    db_init - add function to get all tasks by user id
    db_init - add a couple of tasks to a test user to seed the database
    html - add jinja for-loop to display all tasks belonging to a particular user, check that test data displays when test user is logged in
4. Users Need to Log Out
5. User Can Save Individual Tasks - backend queries database by task_id each time to display list 
6. Users can update profile information
7. User can pick between light and dark mode


#add tasks from profile page, saved with users
#UI issue/confusion with profile page, adding settings then having to go back to homepage 
#profile should be like homepage+ with full task list/timer functionality, only with customization

#write a function to call timer twice, once with work interval, once with break interval. This is to auto-populate timer with countdown 

#consider adding ajax to task add/delete functionality 

Possible extra - use JavaScript sessionStorage to make login-less version of task manager
