  Simple Focus provides users with a timer that can be filled using custom work and break times. Using this timer, it's easy to keep track of how long a work session or a break should last, freeing you to focus on your task.

  **Buttons**

  - Stop Timer: Stops Timer
  - Work Session: Fills timer with preferred work time
  - Break Session: Fills timer with preferred break time

- **Task List**
  Listing and organizing tasks is simple with the task list feature. Just use the "Add Task" form to add a new task, and then see it appear as a task card in the task list. To delete a task from the list, simply press the "delete" button on the appropriate task.

- **Light/Dark Mode**
  Ensure a comfortable experience with the light/dark mode feature. Toggle between light and dark mode using the drop-down menu in the bottom right of your dashboard, under "user preferences".

- **User Accounts**
  You must be signed in to use Simple Focus. Once signed in, you can store tasks in your task list for later. Task list cards persist between sessions. Update your user preferences using the form on the bottom right of your dashboard.
